As a former Sales and Startup Leader, I enjoy working with people to build great companies. Understanding the potential and business opportunities that open with knowing how to code, I switched careers to become a full-stack developer. I see my future career path growing as a developer and leader, leading different teams across various disciplines including the technical aspects of the product. I'm flexible, curious about, and open to learning other languages and technologies.",
