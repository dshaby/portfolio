    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Shaby. I grew up in the Los Angeles area, and later attended UC Berkeley where I earned a dual Bachelor's Degree in Economics and Public Health. While a student, I enrolled in several Computer Science courses, such as Data Structures and Algorithms, where I developed an interest in computer science and web development. Since graduating in 2020, I have primarily remained in Los Angeles where I co-founded BOTE, and later was hired at Crown Clothing. Currently, I am remotely employed at Bynder as a Front End Engineer.",
